// how the execution happens

// execution context

// global execution context to banta hi hai
// gec be this ki value browser k hisab se aati hai

// there are two phases for running a js prg
// 1. memory creation phase
// 2. execution phase

// variables ko undefined krke rakhte hai
// and functions ko pura rakhte hai memory k sath

// everytime the function is called a new
// execution context is created and execution thread also created

// again the same thing is done for every function in js
// the two phases will happen as the function is encountered in js
// in global execution context

// call stack happens as they happen in c++

// time milega to go through krna hai ki kaise chrome me dekh sakte hai
// call stack ko
